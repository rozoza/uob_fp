01.19,151,28,hoffmann,"Secondly , is it making a taxable supply to its members in the course or furtherance of a business which it carries on ?",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

01.19,160,30,hoffmann,"This confirms the construction which the Interpretation Act gives to "" person "" in the term "" taxable person "" .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,161,31,hoffmann,"The next stage is to ask whether the Association is not only a person but a "" taxable person "" .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,162,31,hoffmann,"But this turns out to be linked with the second question about whether the Association is making taxable supplies to its members , because a taxable person is defined as a person who is , or is required to be , registered for VAT ( section 3 ( 1 ) ) and a person is required to be registered ( subjectto a minimum turnover requirement and other immaterial qualifications ) if he is making taxable supplies : see Schedule 1 .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

01.19,164,31,hoffmann,"If so , it is a taxable person .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,165,31,hoffmann,"In fact , the question may be even narrower , because Mr Smouha ( who appeared for the Association ) said that unless the facilities provided by the persons employed on behalf of the members of the Association were a taxable supply to its members , the consideration for the other facilities would be insufficient to bring the Association within the registration requirement .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,166,31,hoffmann,So the question is whether the Association is making a taxable supply by providing its members with the services of its employees or the right to avail themselves of those services .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,167,32,hoffmann,"My Lords , an unincorporated association is , as I have said , not a legal entity .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no

01.19,174,33,hoffmann,I think that there are two .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,175,33,hoffmann,"First , it is necessary that there should be something which can be described as an association .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,176,33,hoffmann,"Secondly , the facility or service in question must be provided in accordance with the rules of the association and must be in consideration of a payment into the funds of the association .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,177,34,hoffmann,The first condition is the existence of an association rather than simply a contractual arrangement for jointly obtaining goods and services and sharing their expense .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

01.19,180,34,hoffmann,What can be done is to list features which are normally present in an association .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,181,34,hoffmann,"So , for example , it will usually have a set of rules which constitute a mutually binding contract between the members , a statement of its objects and provisions for its governance by a committee or committees , the admission of members and the cessation of membership ( giving the association a continuity beyond its original members ) and provisions ( or a rule-making power ) for the terms and conditions upon which members may enjoy the benefits of membership .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,182,34,hoffmann,This list of the paradigm characteristics of an association is not intended to be exhaustive .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,183,34,hoffmann,"Furthermore , it is perfectly possible for contractual arrangements to lack one or more of these features and still be regarded as constituting an association .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,184,34,hoffmann,"But the further the arrangements depart from those of the standard case , the less likely they are to be treated as an association for the purposes of the Act .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,185,35,hoffmann,The second condition is to exclude arrangements which are not with members as such but involve the association acting simply as an ordinary third party .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,186,35,hoffmann,"For example , if two members of a club ask the wine steward to buy them a case of wine as part of the club 's next order , undertaking to reimburse the cost , there is no supply to the members by the club .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

01.19,197,37,hoffmann,And the payment of subscriptions was on the basis of simply dividing the expenses of the association among the members pro rata in accordance with the time for which they had been members .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no
01.19,198,38,hoffmann,In my opinion these features do not alter the character of the transaction as a supply by the association to the members .,DISPOSAL,001,NONE,no

01.42,184,35,hoffmann,The argument that the public is given the possibility of watching the event if the public broadcasters are given the possibility of buying the rights at a fair auction is in my opinion wrong .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no

01.42,189,36,hoffmann,The Court of Appeal appear to have been influenced by their view that in domestic cases the ITC 's criteria as stated in the code for giving consent under section 101 was to require no more than a fair auction in which the public broadcasters had a reasonable opportunity to bid .,FRAMING,007,NONE,no
01.42,190,36,hoffmann,"In my opinion , that is an over-simplification .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.42,191,36,hoffmann,"Indeed , if that were the beginning and end of the matter , Part IV of the 1996 Act would serve very little purpose and Parliament might as well have left the allocation of listed sporting events to market forces in the same way as Premier League matches .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.42,192,37,hoffmann,It is true that paragraph 13 of the code contemplates a process of bidding for de facto exclusive rights and lays down criteria for the fairness of the bidding process .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.42,193,37,hoffmann,"But the ITC also makes it clear that it will have to be satisfied that the public broadcasters had the opportunity to acquire the rights on "" fair and reasonable terms . """,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.42,194,37,hoffmann,It can be said that the market price for the rights is what they will fetch on the open market and prima facie an opportunity to buy at the market price is an opportunity to buy at fair and reasonable terms .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.42,195,37,hoffmann,"But this principle , if generally applied , would , as I have said , make the whole regulatory machinery in Part IV fairly pointless .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

01.42,197,37,hoffmann,Of course the ITC may consider that the answer should be the same for both categories ; the public broadcasters are not without resources and market power and the ITC may take the view that the rights in question should simply be left to fair and open competition .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

01.42,200,38,hoffmann,The code has to be read in the context of the regulatory scheme created by Part IV and in my opinion it does not necessarily require the ITC to give consent to a broadcaster who has bid highest in a free and open competition .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no

01.42,211,39,hoffmann,"But once it is recognised that this does not necessarily require the ITC to accept the outcome of an auction as a fair price , there seem to me no hard and fast line which limits the matters which the ITC can take into account in deciding whether the price offered to the public broadcasters was fair or not .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.42,212,40,hoffmann,"Likewise , it seems to me that the Court of Appeal overstated the uncertainties of "" regulation at the point of exercise "" .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no

01.42,217,40,hoffmann,"The Danish system , for example , enables a pay-TV broadcaster who has acquired exclusive rights to obtain within 14 days an answer as to whether the public broadcasters are interested or not .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no

01.42,219,40,hoffmann,"It may be , as the Court of Appeal suggested , that a regulatory system in which a pay-TV broadcaster has to offer to share the rights with a public broadcaster means that any event which the latter wishes to broadcast will be unattractive to the pay-TV broadcaster and that the value of the rights will be depressed .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no

01.42,230,43,hoffmann,"It is true that article 3a ( 3 ) speaks of exclusive rights "" purchased ... following the date of publication of this Directive "" by the broadcasters and it was suggested that the article only operates once the rights have been purchased .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

01.42,235,44,hoffmann,"The system of reciprocal enforcement created by article 3a requires that regulation should as far as possible be harmonised , so that the rights of the public to watch an event of national importance in a member state should not be affected by whether the broadcaster is in that or another member state .",FRAMING,008,NONE,no
01.42,236,44,hoffmann,"I say "" as far as possible "" because the ITC also has to have regard to the interests of UK broadcasters .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.42,237,44,hoffmann,But the regulatory system of each member state has to be approved by the Commission under article 3a ( 2 ) and one would therefore not expect its application to be an unreasonable restriction on the rights of broadcasters in other member states .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
01.42,238,45,hoffmann,"Any broadcaster in any member state who is considering the purchase of exclusive rights to broadcast in Denmark an event designated under Danish law must , as it seems to me , take into account the Danish system of regulation .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no

02.29,5,1,slynn,"The first is that the jurisdiction recognised in Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Commissioners [ 1974 ] AC 133 to order disclosure of , inter alia , the identity of a source of information or documents does not depend on whether the person against whom the order is sought has committed a tort , a breach of contract or other civil or criminal wrong .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no

02.29,7,2,slynn,This latter requirement together with the residual discretion of the court as to whether it is right that an order should be made in all the circumstances provide a safeguard against an unjustified order for discovery .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
02.29,8,2,slynn,"No one can or should forget the importance of the freedom of the press but it is plain as article 10 of the European Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ( 1953 ) and section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 require , that there are restrictions which are to be accepted as necessary in a democratic society .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
02.29,9,3,slynn,"The second point is that it is not a necessary precondition of the exercise of the jurisdiction that the applicant should have begun , or had an intention to begin , legal proceedings inrespectof the allegedly wrongful act - in cases like these against the source .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no
02.29,10,3,slynn,"My noble and learned friend 's reference to the speeches in British Steel Corp v Granada Television Ltd [ 1981 ] AC 1096 and in particular to the judgments of Lord Denning MR , at p 1127 , and of Templeman LJ , at p 1132 , in the Court of Appeal seems to me to establish this point conclusively despite the very well argued submissions of Mr Browne QC to the contrary .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

02.29,58,17,woolf,"It is part of the agreed facts that leaks to the press have a detrimental effect on security ; treatment of patients and staff morale , because they may inhibit proper recording of information about patients ; may deter patients from providing information about themselves ; may damage the patient-doctor relationship , which rests on trust ; may lead to assaults by patients on a patient about whom information is disclosed ; may create an atmosphere of distrust amongst staff , which is detrimental to efficient and co-operative work ; and give rise to fear of future ( and potentially more damaging ) leaks .",FRAMING,009,NONE,no

02.45,45,9,bingham,"If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

02.45,407,82,rodger,"Nevertheless , the fact that the respondent 's case has at least some of the characteristics of one where no right to buy would arise under paragraph 5 of Schedule 5 makes it somewhat different from the run-of-the-mill case of a secure tenant acquiring his council house .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
02.45,408,82,rodger,"More particularly , the fact that the flat is situated in a small complex of buildings near to where the public have access gave some scope for Croydon to argue at the public inquiry that the security and convenient running of the park and neighbouring premises might be adversely affected if the flat passed from their ownership and control .",FACT,NONE,NONE,no

02.47,60,12,bingham,"First , convicted murderers serving the tariff term of their mandatory life sentences cannot know whether they will be released at the end of it or not , and so ( unlike prisoners serving determinate sentences ) will spend years on end uncertain about their date of release .",PROCEEDINGS,007,NONE,no

02.47,64,12,bingham,"But in the cases of those not judged to be dangerous the safeguards serve no valid penological purpose ; they are arbitrary , excessive and disproportionate ; and so they offend articles 3 and 5 of the convention .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no
02.47,65,13,bingham,I do not regard this argument as either trivial or misconceived .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
02.47,66,13,bingham,The sentence of life imprisonment is now the most severe penalty for which the law provides .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
02.47,67,13,bingham,"There is ground for concern if the sentence is imposed on those who , despite the seriousness of their crimes , could be adequately punished by a determinate sentence .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
02.47,68,13,bingham,"Indeed , any mandatory or minimum mandatory sentence arouses concern that it may operate in a disproportionate manner in some cases .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
02.47,69,13,bingham,"It was considerations of this kind which led the Supreme Court of Canada to conclude that a mandatory 7 year minimum sentence for importing drugs was incompatible with section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which guaranteed that no one should be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment : R v Smith ( Edward Dewey ) [ 1987 ] 1 SCR 1045 .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

02.47,75,14,bingham,"The fact that section 1 ( 1 ) represents the settled will of a democratic assembly is not a conclusive reason for upholding it , but a degree of deference is due to the judgment of a democratic assembly on how a particular social problem is best tackled : see Brown v Stott [ 2001 ] 2 WLR 817 at 834 - 835 , 842 ; R ( Mahmood ) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [ 2001 ] 1 WLR 840 at 854 - 855 , paragraph 33 , and 856 , paragraph 38 .",FRAMING,003,NONE,no

02.47,98,16,bingham,"There is , inevitably , a balance to be struck between the interest of the individual and the interest of society , and I do not think it objectionable , in the case of someone who has once taken life with the intent necessary for murder , to prefer the latter in case of doubt .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
02.47,99,16,bingham,"In any event , this is a defensible process : material going to show that a prisoner is not dangerous will be before the board , and if the board is thought to show an exaggerated degree of caution it can be challenged .",FRAMING,009,NONE,no
02.47,100,16,bingham,"I would again accept that a convicted murderer would very much prefer not to be subject , on leaving prison , to a life licence carrying the threat of indefinite recall .",FRAMING,010,NONE,no
02.47,101,16,bingham,"But a prisoner released , as Ms Lichniak has been , should be in no danger of recall in the absence of any resort to violence , and the 1997 Act provides ( in section 32 ) that the propriety of any recall shall be the subject of independent assessment by the Parole Board .",FRAMING,010,NONE,no

02.47,118,23,hutton,It is clear that the Parole Board considered that the appellant Lichniak would not constitute a risk to the public if she were released and on its recommendation the Home Secretary released her on licence relatively soon after she had completed the tariff period for retribution and deterrence which he had fixed at 11 years .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no

02.47,171,32,hutton,He submitted that when a life sentence is imposed on a convicted murderer the prisoner will not know whether he will be released at the end of the tariff period or whether he will continue to be imprisoned because the view is taken that his release would constitute a danger to the public .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no

02.47,174,33,hutton,Mr Fitzgerald also submitted that the law should give the convicted person the opportunity at his trial to satisfy the trial judge that he would not be a risk in the future and to obtain a formal ruling from him to this effect which would determine that he should be released at the end of the tariff period for retribution and deterrence .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no

03.07,135,19,hoffmann,But there is more than one difficulty about this argument .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.07,136,19,hoffmann,The first is that the customer is not free to say that he will take the seller 's double glazing but wishes to shop around for insurance .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

03.07,139,19,hoffmann,In practice this is inevitable because the insurance is against the taxpayer becoming insolvent and such insurance is unlikely to be obtainable without the taxpayer 's co-operation .,FRAMING,005,NONE,no
03.07,140,19,hoffmann,So the figure which will interest the customer is not the charge for insurance but the total contract price .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.07,141,20,hoffmann,"In response to this obvious difficulty , Mr Paines puts the argument in a weaker form , namely that an excessive charge for insurance will irritate the customer and make it more likely that he will try to find a lower overall price from another supplier .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no

03.44,86,17,hoffmann,"The first is that its purpose is not to ascertain whether the applicant can survive , or enjoy a reasonable diet , without assistance .",FRAMING,003,NONE,no
03.44,87,17,hoffmann,"It is a notional test , a thought-experiment , to calibrate the severity of the disability .",FRAMING,004,NONE,no
03.44,88,17,hoffmann,It does not matter whether the applicant actually needs to cook .,FRAMING,004,NONE,no
03.44,89,17,hoffmann,"As the form DLA 1 said , "" try to imagine how much help you would need if you tried to do this . """,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,90,17,hoffmann,"No doubt some people ( disabled or otherwise ) do need to cook or prefer to do so , although home cooking seems to be fighting a losing battle against convenience foods and ready-cooked meals .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,91,17,hoffmann,"Not for nothing is the notional meal contemplated by the cooking test described in the authorities as "" traditional "" .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,92,17,hoffmann,"It must be remembered that disability living allowance is a non-contributory , non-means tested benefit .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,93,17,hoffmann,"A person who cannot cook for himself is entitled to the allowance , now # 14.90 a week , whether he solves the eating problem by obtaining help , having a wife , buying television dinners or dining at the Savoy .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,94,17,hoffmann,"On the other hand , even if a person needs to cook and has the motor skills to do so , he may still need assistance ; to obtain the ingredients which the test assumes him to have , or because he is culinarily incompetent .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,95,17,hoffmann,"So in my view the Court of Appeal was wrong to lay such emphasis upon the fact that unless the applicant could cook more or less every day , she would not enjoy a reasonable quality of life .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,96,18,hoffmann,"That leads on to the second point , which is that the test says nothing about how often the person should be able to cook .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,97,18,hoffmann,It would have been easy for Parliament to say that a person should be able to cook daily or six times a week or whatever .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

03.44,101,18,hoffmann,"One possible construction is that if there was a single occasion during the period when a remission in his disability would have allowed him to cook a meal , it cannot be said that throughout the period he was unable to do so .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,102,18,hoffmann,But the Secretary of State does not contend for this construction and I do not think that it would be right .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,103,18,hoffmann,That is not because one occasion is de minimis but because the test does not in my opinion function at that day to day level .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,104,18,hoffmann,"It involves looking at the whole period and saying whether , in a more general sense , the person can fairly be described as a person who is unable to cook a meal .",FRAMING,005,NONE,no
03.44,105,18,hoffmann,It is an exercise in judgment rather than an arithmetical calculation of frequency .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no

03.44,107,19,hoffmann,The standard of motor abilities required by the cooking test is not so precise as to allow calibration by arithmetical formula .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,108,19,hoffmann,"In the present case , I think that the Court of Appeal attached too much weight to the fact that in her claim form Mrs Moyna had ticked the box "" 1 - 3 days "" for the extent to which she needed help with heavy pans , cutting vegetables and so forth .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,109,19,hoffmann,"In answering the generalised question of whether Mrs Moyna could fairly be described as a person unable to cook , it may be relevant to consider not only the number of occasions on which she says she would need assistance but also the reasons why it would be needed .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,110,19,hoffmann,The tribunal went into the matter in some detail .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,111,19,hoffmann,It observed that she could cook for herself using lighter pans and cutting up smaller vegetables .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,112,19,hoffmann,"In addition , it had the opinion of the examining doctor and his record of Mrs Moyna 's own description of herself as a person who could cook a meal - a description which is , as I have said , not inconsistent with her not being able to do so all the time .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,113,19,hoffmann,These are all items of evidence which go into the decision-making process .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,114,20,hoffmann,"In any case in which a tribunal has to apply a standard with a greater or lesser degree of imprecision and to take a number of factors into account , there are bound to be cases in which it will be impossible for a reviewing court to say that the tribunal must have erred in law in deciding the case either way : see George Mitchell ( Chesterhall ) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd [ 1983 ] 2 AC 803 , 815 - 816 .",FRAMING,007,NONE,no

03.44,117,21,hoffmann,"That is sufficient to dispose of the appeal , but I must say something about an alternative submission by Mr Paines , who appeared for the Secretary of State .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,118,21,hoffmann,"He said the words "" period throughout which . . . he is so severely disabled physically or mentally that ... he cannot prepare a cooked main meal for himself "" were ordinary English words and that their meaning was not a question of law .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,no

03.44,128,23,hoffmann,Lord Reid was in my opinion making two very pertinent points .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,129,23,hoffmann,"First , he was drawing attention to a feature of language ; namely , that many words or phrases are linguistically irreducible in the sense that any attempt to elucidate a sentence by replacing them with synonyms will change rather than explain its meaning .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,130,23,hoffmann,Lord Kilbrandon made the same point in his reference to Dr Johnson at p. 867 .,BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,131,23,hoffmann,"On the other hand , Lord Reid insisted that , whether the statute used simple words or difficult ones , its construction was a question of law .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,132,24,hoffmann,"Lord Reid was here making the well-known distinction between the meaning of a word , which depends upon conventions known to the ordinary speaker of English or ascertainable from a dictionary , and the meaning which the author of an utterance appears to have intended to convey by using that word in a sentence .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,133,24,hoffmann,"The latter depends not only upon the conventional meanings of the words used but also upon syntax , context and background .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,134,24,hoffmann,The meaning of an English word is not a question of law because it does not in itself have any legal significance .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,135,24,hoffmann,It is the meaning to be ascribed to the intention of the notional legislator in using that word which is a statement of law .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,136,24,hoffmann,"It is because of the nature of language that , in trying to ascertain the legislator 's meaning , it is seldom helpful to make additions or substitutions in the actual language he has used .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,137,25,hoffmann,"Lord Reid 's second point is made in the last sentence of the passage I have quoted , when he says that the question of whether the facts found by the tribunal count as "" insulting "" for the purposes of the statute is a question of fact .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,138,25,hoffmann,"There is a good deal of high authority for saying that the question of whether the facts as found or admitted fall one side or the other of some conceptual line drawn by the law is a question of fact : see , for example , Edwards v Bairstow [ 1956 ] AC 14 and O ' Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc [ 1984 ] QB 90 .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,139,25,hoffmann,What this means in practice is that an appellate court with jurisdiction to entertain appeals only on questions of law will not hear an appeal against such a decision unless it falls outside the bounds of reasonable judgment .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,140,26,hoffmann,It may seem rather odd to say that something is a question of fact when there is no dispute whatever over the facts and the question is whether they fall within some legal category .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,141,26,hoffmann,In his classic work on Trial by Jury Lord Devlin said ( at p 61 ) :,BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,142,26.5,hoffmann,""" The questions of law which are for the judge fall into two categories : first , there are questions which cannot be correctly answered except by someone who is skilled in the law ; secondly , there are questions of fact which lawyers have decided that judges can answer better than juries . """,BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,143,27,hoffmann,Likewise it may be said that there are two kinds of questions of fact : there are questions of fact ; and there are questions of law as to which lawyers have decided that it would be inexpedient for an appellate tribunal to have to form an independent judgment .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,144,27,hoffmann,"But the usage is well established and causes no difficulty as long as it is understood that the degree to which an appellate court will be willing to substitute its own judgment for that of the tribunal will vary with the nature of the question : see In re Grayan Building Services Ltd [ 1995 ] Ch 241 , 254 - 255 .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,145,28,hoffmann,"Applying the first of these two points to the facts of the present case , I think that it was unhelpful for the Court of Appeal to construe the statutory language as if it included words like "" daily "" or "" regularly "" .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,146,28,hoffmann,"Applying the second , I think that the decision of the tribunal was within the bounds of reasonable judgment .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no
03.44,147,28,hoffmann,"I therefore think that , properly understood , Lord Reid 's remarks in Brutus v Cozens [ 1973 ] AC 854 , 861 do not lay down some heterodox principle which provides a short cut to dismissing an appeal ( "" the last resort of counsel appearing on behalf of respondents "" as Lord Woolf MR said in R v Radio Authority , Ex p Bull [ 1998 ] QB 294 , 304 ) but are in accordance with established principles and common sense .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,no
