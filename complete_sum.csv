01.42,147,27,Hoffmann,The judge decided that TVD could not have had a legitimate expectation that the ITC would exercise its discretion in a manner contrary to the terms of the Directive and that it had done enough to put TVD on notice that the absence of an offer to share the rights would be taken into account .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE

01.42,149,28,Hoffmann,The court 's reasoning appears to have been made up of three elements .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,150,29,Hoffmann,"First , they pointed out that the Directive was binding upon member states "" as to the result to be achieved "" but left the national authorities the "" choice of form and methods "" : see article 249 of the EC Treaty .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,151,29,Hoffmann,The object of article 3a ( 3 ) was to prevent exclusive rights from being exercised so as to deprive a substantial proportion of the public of the possibility of watching designated events .,PROCEEDINGS,003,no match,no match
01.42,152,29,Hoffmann,But they said that this was not an unqualified object .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,153,29,Hoffmann,"Recitals to the Directive indicated that it was also intended to promote competition , prevent broadcasting authorities from achieving dominant positions and allow free movement of services .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,154,29,Hoffmann,The United Kingdom was therefore entitled to implement the Directive with due regard to these objects as well .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,155,29,Hoffmann,"A free market in sports rights was promoted by a system which had regard solely to the way in which exclusive rights had been acquired ( "" regulation at the point of acquisition "" ) .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,156,29,Hoffmann,"This was the correct interpretation of the code and the ITC was not entitled to have regard to post-acquisition matters : see Kennedy LJ at p 83 , Waller LJ at p 84 and Jonathan Parker LJ at p 85 .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,157,30,Hoffmann,"Secondly , the code allows a free market .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,158,30,Hoffmann,"If a broadcaster has had the opportunity to bid for exclusive rights at a fairly conducted auction and lost , the ITC is bound to be satisfied that he has had the opportunity to acquire the rights on reasonable terms .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,159,31,Hoffmann,"Thirdly , once there has been a fair auction , it cannot be said that a substantial proportion of the public has been deprived of the possibility of watching .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,no match,no match

01.42,163,32,Hoffmann,"The Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport petitioned for leave to intervene on the grounds that the Court of Appeal had misinterpreted article 3a ( 3 ) and exposed the United Kingdom to an action by Denmark or the Commission in the European Court of Justice .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,no match,no match

01.42,167,32.5,Hoffmann,Construction of the Directive,TEXTUAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,168,33,Hoffmann,In my opinion the result which article 3a ( 3 ) requires member states to achieve is perfectly clear .,FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,169,33,Hoffmann,It is to prevent the exercise by broadcasters of exclusive rights in such a way that a substantial proportion of the public in another member state is deprived of the possibility of following a designated event .,FRAMING,003,NONE,NONE
01.42,170,33,Hoffmann,"The obligation to achieve that result is in no way qualified by considerations of competition , free market economics , sanctity of contract and so forth .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,171,33,Hoffmann,The fact that reference is made to these matters in the recitals to the Directive explains why the scope of article 3a is limited in the way it is .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,172,33,Hoffmann,Its terms represent a compromise between the policies in question and the interests of the general public in being able to watch sporting events for free .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,173,33,Hoffmann,Member states are limited in the sporting or other events they may reserve for their public broadcasters .,BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE

01.42,176,33,Hoffmann,"Furthermore , national measures enacted pursuant to Article 3a ( 1 ) must be approved by the Commission under paragraph 2 as "" compatible with Community law "" .",BACKGROUND,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,177,33,Hoffmann,So the balance between the interests of sports organisers and pay-TV broadcasters in maintaining a free market and the perceived interest of the citizen in being able to watch important sporting events has already been struck in the terms in which article 3a has been framed .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,178,33,Hoffmann,It should not be revisited in deciding how a member state should comply with its obligations under article 3a ( 3 ) .,FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,179,34,Hoffmann,The question which article 3a leaves for the decision of a member state is whether exclusive rights are in fact being exercised in such a way as to deprive the public of the possibility of watching .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,180,34,Hoffmann,They are not being so exercised if the public would not have had that possibility anyway .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,181,34,Hoffmann,This is the decision which section 101B leaves to the judgment of the ITC and I shall return in a moment to what seem to me the relevant considerations .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,182,34,Hoffmann,"But section 101B does not , as I have said , give effect in itself to our obligations under article 3a ( 3 ) .",FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,183,34,Hoffmann,It enables the ITC to do so by conferring a discretion which the ITC must exercise to achieve the result required by the Directive .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,184,35,Hoffmann,The argument that the public is given the possibility of watching the event if the public broadcasters are given the possibility of buying the rights at a fair auction is in my opinion wrong .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,185,35,Hoffmann,The Directive requires the public to have the possibility of following the event in the sense that a member of the public may watch it if he chooses to switch on his television set .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,186,35,Hoffmann,"If the match is not being shown on any programme to which he has access , he does not have that possibility .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,187,35,Hoffmann,"The reason may or may not be the way in which the party who has acquired exclusive rights is exercising them , but that is a different question .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,188,35.5,Hoffmann,The free market,TEXTUAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,189,36,Hoffmann,The Court of Appeal appear to have been influenced by their view that in domestic cases the ITC 's criteria as stated in the code for giving consent under section 101 was to require no more than a fair auction in which the public broadcasters had a reasonable opportunity to bid .,FRAMING,007,NONE,NONE
01.42,190,36,Hoffmann,"In my opinion , that is an over-simplification .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,191,36,Hoffmann,"Indeed , if that were the beginning and end of the matter , Part IV of the 1996 Act would serve very little purpose and Parliament might as well have left the allocation of listed sporting events to market forces in the same way as Premier League matches .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,192,37,Hoffmann,It is true that paragraph 13 of the code contemplates a process of bidding for de facto exclusive rights and lays down criteria for the fairness of the bidding process .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,193,37,Hoffmann,"But the ITC also makes it clear that it will have to be satisfied that the public broadcasters had the opportunity to acquire the rights on "" fair and reasonable terms . """,FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,194,37,Hoffmann,It can be said that the market price for the rights is what they will fetch on the open market and prima facie an opportunity to buy at the market price is an opportunity to buy at fair and reasonable terms .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,195,37,Hoffmann,"But this principle , if generally applied , would , as I have said , make the whole regulatory machinery in Part IV fairly pointless .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,196,37,Hoffmann,"The code makes it clear that the ITC will form a view of the value of the rights "" to the broadcasters , "" in other words , what that category of broadcasters could reasonably be expected to pay for them .",FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,197,37,Hoffmann,Of course the ITC may consider that the answer should be the same for both categories ; the public broadcasters are not without resources and market power and the ITC may take the view that the rights in question should simply be left to fair and open competition .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,198,37,Hoffmann,"But the clear purpose of Part IV is , if necessary , to protect the public interest in free access to important sporting events against market forces .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,199,37,Hoffmann,"The ITC is engaged in a delicate balance of the interests of broadcasters , sports organisers and the general public .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,200,38,Hoffmann,The code has to be read in the context of the regulatory scheme created by Part IV and in my opinion it does not necessarily require the ITC to give consent to a broadcaster who has bid highest in a free and open competition .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,201,38,Hoffmann,Nor does it give rise to a legitimate expectation that in such circumstances consent will be given .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,202,38.5,Hoffmann,Exercise and acquistion,TEXTUAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,203,39,Hoffmann,"The Court of Appeal ( adopting Mr Carr 's terminology ) contrasted regulation of sports television rights at the "" point of acquisition "" with regulation at the "" point of exercise "" .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,204,39,Hoffmann,The former was said to be the UK system and the latter the European system for which the ITC was contending .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,205,39,Hoffmann,But the contrast between the two systems seems to me to have been greatly exaggerated .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,206,39,Hoffmann,Both Part IV and the Directive are concerned with the exercise of exclusive rights to designated events .,FRAMING,003,NONE,NONE
01.42,207,39,Hoffmann,"Section 101 provides that a broadcaster in one category shall not "" include in [ its ] service live coverage of the whole or any part of a listed event "" on a de facto exclusive basis without the consent of the ITC .",BACKGROUND,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,208,39,Hoffmann,"Section 101B , echoing the Directive , provides that a broadcaster shall not "" exercise rights to televise the whole or part of an event which is a designated event "" without the consent of the ITC .",BACKGROUND,004,no match,no match
01.42,209,39,Hoffmann,So the statutory result to be achieved is the same .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,210,39,Hoffmann,It is true that the code says that the ITC will ordinarily make its decision under section 101 by reference to the terms on which the rights were acquired .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,211,39,Hoffmann,"But once it is recognised that this does not necessarily require the ITC to accept the outcome of an auction as a fair price , there seem to me no hard and fast line which limits the matters which the ITC can take into account in deciding whether the price offered to the public broadcasters was fair or not .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,212,40,Hoffmann,"Likewise , it seems to me that the Court of Appeal overstated the uncertainties of "" regulation at the point of exercise "" .",DISPOSAL,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,213,40,Hoffmann,"Kennedy LJ , for example , said that it would mean that a public broadcaster could require to be given a second ( or third ) chance to acquire the rights at any time before the broadcast : [ 2001 ] 1 WLR 74 , 83 .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,214,40,Hoffmann,"The holder of the right would not know whether he could spent money on advertising , would be uncertain as to whether he could recover the price he had paid and so on .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,215,40,Hoffmann,"All this seems to suppose that unless one altogether excludes from consideration anything which happens after the rights have been acquired , the system is bound to operate in a thoroughly unreasonable way .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,216,40,Hoffmann,But this is not the case .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,217,40,Hoffmann,"The Danish system , for example , enables a pay-TV broadcaster who has acquired exclusive rights to obtain within 14 days an answer as to whether the public broadcasters are interested or not .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,218,40,Hoffmann,"And one suspects that in practice broadcasters "" design around "" these formal steps in order to achieve certainty at an even earlier stage .",FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,219,40,Hoffmann,"It may be , as the Court of Appeal suggested , that a regulatory system in which a pay-TV broadcaster has to offer to share the rights with a public broadcaster means that any event which the latter wishes to broadcast will be unattractive to the pay-TV broadcaster and that the value of the rights will be depressed .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,220,40,Hoffmann,But that is a consequence which inevitably follows from the protection which the Directive was intended to confer upon the public right of access to such events .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,221,40.5,Hoffmann,The Danish factor,TEXTUAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,222,41,Hoffmann,"The decision as to whether article 3a ( 3 ) requires that a UK broadcaster should not be allowed to exercise exclusive rights to broadcast an event designated by another member state is , by virtue of section 101B , a matter for the ITC .",BACKGROUND,004,no match,no match
01.42,223,41,Hoffmann,It is not bound by the decision which the regulator in the other member state would have made .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,224,41,Hoffmann,"The words "" as determined by that other member state inaccordancewith paragraph 1 "" at the end of article 3a ( 3 ) refer only to the matters which paragraph 1 says are for the determination of the member state , namely designated events and the question of whether the events should be available via whole or partial live coverage or whole or partial deferred coverage .",FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,225,42,Hoffmann,The ITC 's view was that it would accept the Danish law on these matters and also on the question of what amounted to a substantial proportion of the public .,FACT,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,226,42,Hoffmann,Otherwise the decision was a matter for them .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,227,42,Hoffmann,That seems to me correct .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,228,43,Hoffmann,The ITC also rejected the suggestion of the Danish Ministry of Culture in a letter of 20 July 2000 that it should have no regard to the terms upon which TVD had acquired its rights .,FACT,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,229,43,Hoffmann,In my view that too was correct .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,230,43,Hoffmann,"It is true that article 3a ( 3 ) speaks of exclusive rights "" purchased ... following the date of publication of this Directive "" by the broadcasters and it was suggested that the article only operates once the rights have been purchased .",FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,231,43,Hoffmann,Of course they have to be purchased in order to be exercised .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,232,43,Hoffmann,"But that does not mean that the circumstances in which they were purchased are irrelevant to whether they are being exercised "" in such a way "" as to deprive the public of the possibility of watching the event .",FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,233,44,Hoffmann,"On the other hand , the ITC obviously paid considerable regard to the fact that under the Danish system of regulation , a non-qualifying broadcaster is required to offer to share the rights with public broadcasters who can offer sufficient coverage .",FACT,007,NONE,NONE
01.42,234,44,Hoffmann,"Again , this seems to me to be right .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,235,44,Hoffmann,"The system of reciprocal enforcement created by article 3a requires that regulation should as far as possible be harmonised , so that the rights of the public to watch an event of national importance in a member state should not be affected by whether the broadcaster is in that or another member state .",FRAMING,008,NONE,NONE
01.42,236,44,Hoffmann,"I say "" as far as possible "" because the ITC also has to have regard to the interests of UK broadcasters .",FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,237,44,Hoffmann,But the regulatory system of each member state has to be approved by the Commission under article 3a ( 2 ) and one would therefore not expect its application to be an unreasonable restriction on the rights of broadcasters in other member states .,FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match
01.42,238,45,Hoffmann,"Any broadcaster in any member state who is considering the purchase of exclusive rights to broadcast in Denmark an event designated under Danish law must , as it seems to me , take into account the Danish system of regulation .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,239,45,Hoffmann,That system of regulation will influence the market for such rights in Denmark and prima facie it seems to me right that broadcasters in other member states should have to play by the same rules .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.42,240,45,Hoffmann,That was in my opinion the object which article 3a ( 3 ) was intended to achieve .,FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match

01.57,55,15,Slynn,As to the facts existing at the date of the original decision he concluded that the fact that Mrs Farah 's sister had lived for two months in the appellant authority 's district was not significant and the fact that the respondent had lived in the borough from 31 January April 1998 did not establish the necessary connection .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,no match,no match

01.57,57,16,Slynn,The Court of the Appeal were firmly of the view that the material date for considering whether an applicant had a local connection was the date the authority reviewed its decision .,PROCEEDINGS,011,NONE,NONE
01.57,58,16,Slynn,It was the facts established at that stage which the authority should take into account on its review .,PROCEEDINGS,012,NONE,NONE

01.57,62,17,Slynn,"The question is accordingly whether it can be said that he had no local connection with the district of the appellant authority and in that regard the principal question is whether it can be said that he is , or in the past was , normally resident in the district of that authority .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.57,63,17,Slynn,"The authority 's principle argument is that the occupation of interim accommodation pending a decision of his application under the Act is not ( ie cannot be ) "" normal residence "" for the purposes of section 199 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Act .",PROCEEDINGS,007,no match,no match
01.57,64,17,Slynn,The respondent has lost his normal residence and has asked for and was given only temporary shelter until replacement accommodation is provided .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
01.57,65,17,Slynn,At the relevant time accordingly he had no normal residence so that he could not establish a local connection on the ground of residence .,PROCEEDINGS,005,NONE,NONE

01.57,69,18,Slynn,It is clear that words like ordinary residence and normal residence may take their precise meaning from the context of the legislation in which they appear but it seems to me that the prima facie meaning of normal residence is a place where at the relevant time the person in fact resides .,DISPOSAL,008,NONE,NONE

02.30,369,56,Browne-Wilkinson,"Accordingly , in the present case it was of minor importance to the parties whether the Grahams were given possession of the land : what was important was that they did not enjoy whatever rights they had for a full year .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
02.30,370,56,Browne-Wilkinson,Hence the grant of the grazing right for eleven months only and the express provision in clause 9 that a further term would only be granted by a new and distinct contract starting after the termination of 1 February 1983 agreement .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
02.30,371,56,Browne-Wilkinson,It is against this background that the question whether the Grahams obtained possession or not has to be determined .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
02.30,372,56,Browne-Wilkinson,"The fact that clause 5 contains a covenant by the Grahams "" not to part with possession "" and clause 10 expressly makes Pye 's right to regain "" possession "" during the term dependent on serving a notice does not provide a promising basis for the holding of the Court of Appeal that the "" parties plainly did not intend that the Grahams should have exclusive possession "" .",FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match

02.30,390,59,Browne-Wilkinson,"Therefore , as the judge pointed out , the Grahams by grazing the land during 1984 and thereafter were not only acting without permission of the paper owner : they were acting in a way which , to their knowledge , was directly contrary to the wishes of the proprietors .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
02.30,391,60,Browne-Wilkinson,"The third limb of the Court of Appeal reasoning is that Michael Graham 's evidence , contrary to his interest , was consistent with the Grahams ' intention being not to possess the land on their own behalf but only to graze it as though there continued to be a grazing licence .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE

02.45,45,9,Bingham,"If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V .",FRAMING,NONE,no match,no match

02.47,164,30,Hutton,"Although the appellant Lichniak was released on licence after she had served the tariff period and it appears very probable that the appellant Pyrah will be released on licence when he has served the tariff period so that the point is not of direct relevance to their cases , it is appropriate to observe that the European Court has held in Stafford v United Kingdom that after the expiration of the tariff period the decision whether to continue the detention of a mandatory life prisoner in order to protect the public from risk must be taken by a judicial tribunal , the Court stating , in para 87 of its judgment :",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE

02.47,170,32,Hutton,"Although the opinion of the European Commission and the judgment of the European Court in V v United Kingdom appear to present a considerable obstacle to his submissions , Mr Fitzgerald advanced three particular reasons in support of his argument that the sentences of life imprisonment in these two cases were arbitrary .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
02.47,171,32,Hutton,He submitted that when a life sentence is imposed on a convicted murderer the prisoner will not know whether he will be released at the end of the tariff period or whether he will continue to be imprisoned because the view is taken that his release would constitute a danger to the public .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE

02.47,173,32,Hutton,"Therefore he argued that it was arbitrary in cases such as those of the two appellants to sentence the prisoner to an indefinite sentence which might not end at the termination of the tariff period where ( as was the position in these two cases ) the trial judge , with his detailed knowledge of the facts of the case , considered that the prisoner would not be a risk to the public in the future .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,no match,no match
02.47,174,33,Hutton,Mr Fitzgerald also submitted that the law should give the convicted person the opportunity at his trial to satisfy the trial judge that he would not be a risk in the future and to obtain a formal ruling from him to this effect which would determine that he should be released at the end of the tariff period for retribution and deterrence .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
02.47,175,33,Hutton,He argued that to impose a life sentence on a prisoner who the judge considered would not be a risk to the public in the future was to impose an arbitrary punishment .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
02.47,176,34,Hutton,"In support of this submission Mr Fitzgerald relied on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v Offen [ 2001 ] 1 WLR 253 where consideration was given to section 2 of the Crime ( Sentences ) Act 1997 which required a court to impose a life sentence on a person convicted of a serious offence ( as defined in section 2 ( 5 ) ) when he had previously been convicted of another serious offence , unless the court considered that there were exceptional circumstances related to either of the offences or to the offender which justified it in not doing so .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,no match,no match

02.47,180,35,Hutton,"It will not infrequently be the case that the behaviour of a prisoner during the time he is serving the tariff period , and his behaviour on home leave , will give clear indications whether or not he would be a danger to others if released on licence .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE

03.07,135,19,Hoffmann,But there is more than one difficulty about this argument .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
03.07,136,19,Hoffmann,The first is that the customer is not free to say that he will take the seller 's double glazing but wishes to shop around for insurance .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
03.07,137,19,Hoffmann,The taxpayer is not willing to contract on such terms .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
03.07,138,19,Hoffmann,He is selling a single package which includes both double glazing and insurance .,FRAMING,004,NONE,NONE
03.07,139,19,Hoffmann,In practice this is inevitable because the insurance is against the taxpayer becoming insolvent and such insurance is unlikely to be obtainable without the taxpayer 's co-operation .,FRAMING,005,NONE,NONE
03.07,140,19,Hoffmann,So the figure which will interest the customer is not the charge for insurance but the total contract price .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
03.07,141,20,Hoffmann,"In response to this obvious difficulty , Mr Paines puts the argument in a weaker form , namely that an excessive charge for insurance will irritate the customer and make it more likely that he will try to find a lower overall price from another supplier .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE
03.07,142,20,Hoffmann,But this is also unlikely to discourage value shifting .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE

03.07,146,21,Hoffmann,That will prevent him from avoiding or evading VAT by subsequent retrospective adjustments .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE

03.44,132,24,Hoffmann,"Lord Reid was here making the well-known distinction between the meaning of a word , which depends upon conventions known to the ordinary speaker of English or ascertainable from a dictionary , and the meaning which the author of an utterance appears to have intended to convey by using that word in a sentence .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
03.44,133,24,Hoffmann,"The latter depends not only upon the conventional meanings of the words used but also upon syntax , context and background .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE
03.44,134,24,Hoffmann,The meaning of an English word is not a question of law because it does not in itself have any legal significance .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE

03.44,137,25,Hoffmann,"Lord Reid 's second point is made in the last sentence of the passage I have quoted , when he says that the question of whether the facts found by the tribunal count as "" insulting "" for the purposes of the statute is a question of fact .",BACKGROUND,NONE,no match,no match
03.44,138,25,Hoffmann,"There is a good deal of high authority for saying that the question of whether the facts as found or admitted fall one side or the other of some conceptual line drawn by the law is a question of fact : see , for example , Edwards v Bairstow [ 1956 ] AC 14 and O ' Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc [ 1984 ] QB 90 .",BACKGROUND,NONE,no match,no match
