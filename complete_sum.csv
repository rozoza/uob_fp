1.42,2,188,169,33,hoffmann,It is to prevent the exercise by broadcasters of exclusive rights in such a way that a substantial proportion of the public in another member state is deprived of the possibility of following a designated event .,FRAMING,003,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,189,170,33,hoffmann,"The obligation to achieve that result is in no way qualified by considerations of competition , free market economics , sanctity of contract and so forth .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,190,171,33,hoffmann,The fact that reference is made to these matters in the recitals to the Directive explains why the scope of article 3a is limited in the way it is .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,191,172,33,hoffmann,Its terms represent a compromise between the policies in question and the interests of the general public in being able to watch sporting events for free .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,192,173,33,hoffmann,Member states are limited in the sporting or other events they may reserve for their public broadcasters .,BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,193,174,33,hoffmann,"Only those of "" major importance for society "" can qualify .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,194,175,33,hoffmann,"Premier League football matches , for example , are subject to a free market .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,195,176,33,hoffmann,"Furthermore , national measures enacted pursuant to Article 3a ( 1 ) must be approved by the Commission under paragraph 2 as "" compatible with Community law "" .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,196,177,33,hoffmann,So the balance between the interests of sports organisers and pay-TV broadcasters in maintaining a free market and the perceived interest of the citizen in being able to watch important sporting events has already been struck in the terms in which article 3a has been framed .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,197,178,33,hoffmann,It should not be revisited in deciding how a member state should comply with its obligations under article 3a ( 3 ) .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,199,179,34,hoffmann,The question which article 3a leaves for the decision of a member state is whether exclusive rights are in fact being exercised in such a way as to deprive the public of the possibility of watching .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,200,180,34,hoffmann,They are not being so exercised if the public would not have had that possibility anyway .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,201,181,34,hoffmann,This is the decision which section 101B leaves to the judgment of the ITC and I shall return in a moment to what seem to me the relevant considerations .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,202,182,34,hoffmann,"But section 101B does not , as I have said , give effect in itself to our obligations under article 3a ( 3 ) .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,203,183,34,hoffmann,It enables the ITC to do so by conferring a discretion which the ITC must exercise to achieve the result required by the Directive .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,205,184,35,hoffmann,The argument that the public is given the possibility of watching the event if the public broadcasters are given the possibility of buying the rights at a fair auction is in my opinion wrong .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,206,185,35,hoffmann,The Directive requires the public to have the possibility of following the event in the sense that a member of the public may watch it if he chooses to switch on his television set .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,207,186,35,hoffmann,"If the match is not being shown on any programme to which he has access , he does not have that possibility .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,208,187,35,hoffmann,"The reason may or may not be the way in which the party who has acquired exclusive rights is exercising them , but that is a different question .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,209,188,35.5,hoffmann,The free market,TEXTUAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,210,189,36,hoffmann,The Court of Appeal appear to have been influenced by their view that in domestic cases the ITC 's criteria as stated in the code for giving consent under section 101 was to require no more than a fair auction in which the public broadcasters had a reasonable opportunity to bid .,FRAMING,007,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,211,190,36,hoffmann,"In my opinion , that is an over-simplification .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,212,191,36,hoffmann,"Indeed , if that were the beginning and end of the matter , Part IV of the 1996 Act would serve very little purpose and Parliament might as well have left the allocation of listed sporting events to market forces in the same way as Premier League matches .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,214,192,37,hoffmann,It is true that paragraph 13 of the code contemplates a process of bidding for de facto exclusive rights and lays down criteria for the fairness of the bidding process .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,215,193,37,hoffmann,"But the ITC also makes it clear that it will have to be satisfied that the public broadcasters had the opportunity to acquire the rights on "" fair and reasonable terms . """,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,216,194,37,hoffmann,It can be said that the market price for the rights is what they will fetch on the open market and prima facie an opportunity to buy at the market price is an opportunity to buy at fair and reasonable terms .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,217,195,37,hoffmann,"But this principle , if generally applied , would , as I have said , make the whole regulatory machinery in Part IV fairly pointless .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,218,196,37,hoffmann,"The code makes it clear that the ITC will form a view of the value of the rights "" to the broadcasters , "" in other words , what that category of broadcasters could reasonably be expected to pay for them .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,219,197,37,hoffmann,Of course the ITC may consider that the answer should be the same for both categories ; the public broadcasters are not without resources and market power and the ITC may take the view that the rights in question should simply be left to fair and open competition .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,220,198,37,hoffmann,"But the clear purpose of Part IV is , if necessary , to protect the public interest in free access to important sporting events against market forces .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,221,199,37,hoffmann,"The ITC is engaged in a delicate balance of the interests of broadcasters , sports organisers and the general public .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,223,200,38,hoffmann,The code has to be read in the context of the regulatory scheme created by Part IV and in my opinion it does not necessarily require the ITC to give consent to a broadcaster who has bid highest in a free and open competition .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,224,201,38,hoffmann,Nor does it give rise to a legitimate expectation that in such circumstances consent will be given .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE

1.42,2,226,203,39,hoffmann,"The Court of Appeal ( adopting Mr Carr 's terminology ) contrasted regulation of sports television rights at the "" point of acquisition "" with regulation at the "" point of exercise "" .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,227,204,39,hoffmann,The former was said to be the UK system and the latter the European system for which the ITC was contending .,PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,228,205,39,hoffmann,But the contrast between the two systems seems to me to have been greatly exaggerated .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,229,206,39,hoffmann,Both Part IV and the Directive are concerned with the exercise of exclusive rights to designated events .,FRAMING,003,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,230,207,39,hoffmann,"Section 101 provides that a broadcaster in one category shall not "" include in [ its ] service live coverage of the whole or any part of a listed event "" on a de facto exclusive basis without the consent of the ITC .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,231,208,39,hoffmann,"Section 101B , echoing the Directive , provides that a broadcaster shall not "" exercise rights to televise the whole or part of an event which is a designated event "" without the consent of the ITC .",BACKGROUND,004,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,232,209,39,hoffmann,So the statutory result to be achieved is the same .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,233,210,39,hoffmann,It is true that the code says that the ITC will ordinarily make its decision under section 101 by reference to the terms on which the rights were acquired .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,234,211,39,hoffmann,"But once it is recognised that this does not necessarily require the ITC to accept the outcome of an auction as a fair price , there seem to me no hard and fast line which limits the matters which the ITC can take into account in deciding whether the price offered to the public broadcasters was fair or not .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,236,212,40,hoffmann,"Likewise , it seems to me that the Court of Appeal overstated the uncertainties of "" regulation at the point of exercise "" .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,237,213,40,hoffmann,"Kennedy LJ , for example , said that it would mean that a public broadcaster could require to be given a second ( or third ) chance to acquire the rights at any time before the broadcast : [ 2001 ] 1 WLR 74 , 83 .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,238,214,40,hoffmann,"The holder of the right would not know whether he could spent money on advertising , would be uncertain as to whether he could recover the price he had paid and so on .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,239,215,40,hoffmann,"All this seems to suppose that unless one altogether excludes from consideration anything which happens after the rights have been acquired , the system is bound to operate in a thoroughly unreasonable way .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,240,216,40,hoffmann,But this is not the case .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,241,217,40,hoffmann,"The Danish system , for example , enables a pay-TV broadcaster who has acquired exclusive rights to obtain within 14 days an answer as to whether the public broadcasters are interested or not .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,242,218,40,hoffmann,"And one suspects that in practice broadcasters "" design around "" these formal steps in order to achieve certainty at an even earlier stage .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,243,219,40,hoffmann,"It may be , as the Court of Appeal suggested , that a regulatory system in which a pay-TV broadcaster has to offer to share the rights with a public broadcaster means that any event which the latter wishes to broadcast will be unattractive to the pay-TV broadcaster and that the value of the rights will be depressed .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,244,220,40,hoffmann,But that is a consequence which inevitably follows from the protection which the Directive was intended to confer upon the public right of access to such events .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,245,221,40.5,hoffmann,The Danish factor,TEXTUAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,246,222,41,hoffmann,"The decision as to whether article 3a ( 3 ) requires that a UK broadcaster should not be allowed to exercise exclusive rights to broadcast an event designated by another member state is , by virtue of section 101B , a matter for the ITC .",BACKGROUND,004,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,247,223,41,hoffmann,It is not bound by the decision which the regulator in the other member state would have made .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,248,224,41,hoffmann,"The words "" as determined by that other member state in accordance with paragraph 1 "" at the end of article 3a ( 3 ) refer only to the matters which paragraph 1 says are for the determination of the member state , namely designated events and the question of whether the events should be available via whole or partial live coverage or whole or partial deferred coverage .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,250,225,42,hoffmann,The ITC 's view was that it would accept the Danish law on these matters and also on the question of what amounted to a substantial proportion of the public .,FACT,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,251,226,42,hoffmann,Otherwise the decision was a matter for them .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,252,227,42,hoffmann,That seems to me correct .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,254,228,43,hoffmann,The ITC also rejected the suggestion of the Danish Ministry of Culture in a letter of 20 July 2000 that it should have no regard to the terms upon which TVD had acquired its rights .,FACT,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,255,229,43,hoffmann,In my view that too was correct .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,256,230,43,hoffmann,"It is true that article 3a ( 3 ) speaks of exclusive rights "" purchased ... following the date of publication of this Directive "" by the broadcasters and it was suggested that the article only operates once the rights have been purchased .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,257,231,43,hoffmann,Of course they have to be purchased in order to be exercised .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,258,232,43,hoffmann,"But that does not mean that the circumstances in which they were purchased are irrelevant to whether they are being exercised "" in such a way "" as to deprive the public of the possibility of watching the event .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,260,233,44,hoffmann,"On the other hand , the ITC obviously paid considerable regard to the fact that under the Danish system of regulation , a non-qualifying broadcaster is required to offer to share the rights with public broadcasters who can offer sufficient coverage .",FACT,007,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,261,234,44,hoffmann,"Again , this seems to me to be right .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,262,235,44,hoffmann,"The system of reciprocal enforcement created by article 3a requires that regulation should as far as possible be harmonised , so that the rights of the public to watch an event of national importance in a member state should not be affected by whether the broadcaster is in that or another member state .",FRAMING,008,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,263,236,44,hoffmann,"I say "" as far as possible "" because the ITC also has to have regard to the interests of UK broadcasters .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,264,237,44,hoffmann,But the regulatory system of each member state has to be approved by the Commission under article 3a ( 2 ) and one would therefore not expect its application to be an unreasonable restriction on the rights of broadcasters in other member states .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,266,238,45,hoffmann,"Any broadcaster in any member state who is considering the purchase of exclusive rights to broadcast in Denmark an event designated under Danish law must , as it seems to me , take into account the Danish system of regulation .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,267,239,45,hoffmann,That system of regulation will influence the market for such rights in Denmark and prima facie it seems to me right that broadcasters in other member states should have to play by the same rules .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,268,240,45,hoffmann,That was in my opinion the object which article 3a ( 3 ) was intended to achieve .,FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,269,241,45,hoffmann,The ITC and Mr Jack Beatson QC correctly interpreted it in that way .,DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
1.42,2,270,242,45,hoffmann,"In addition , the ITC is entitled to consider that the foreign regulator or arbitral body , such as the Danish Competition Council , acquainted as it is with its national market in television rights , will be best placed to form a view on whether its public broadcasters have refused a reasonable offer at a reasonable price .",DISPOSAL,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE

3.44,60,142,129,23,hoffmann,"First , he was drawing attention to a feature of language ; namely , that many words or phrases are linguistically irreducible in the sense that any attempt to elucidate a sentence by replacing them with synonyms will change rather than explain its meaning .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE

3.44,60,146,132,24,hoffmann,"Lord Reid was here making the well-known distinction between the meaning of a word , which depends upon conventions known to the ordinary speaker of English or ascertainable from a dictionary , and the meaning which the author of an utterance appears to have intended to convey by using that word in a sentence .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
3.44,60,147,133,24,hoffmann,"The latter depends not only upon the conventional meanings of the words used but also upon syntax , context and background .",FRAMING,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE

3.44,60,153,138,25,hoffmann,"There is a good deal of high authority for saying that the question of whether the facts as found or admitted fall one side or the other of some conceptual line drawn by the law is a question of fact : see , for example , Edwards v Bairstow [ 1956 ] AC 14 and O ' Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc [ 1984 ] QB 90 .",BACKGROUND,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE

3.45,48,76,63,11,hope,"He also said that , if the plank snapped 11 feet above the floor of the tank in the way the respondent described , it was unlikely that the respondent would be found lying on top of it or that the two broken pieces of it would be found so close to their original position relative to one another .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE

3.45,48,81,67,12,hope,"It was suggested that the respondent , who was unable to communicate for several weeks after the accident , may have been suffering from retrograde amnesia .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE

3.45,48,87,72,13,hope,"Another factor in the case was the possibility that the respondent had derived his account of the accident from Mr Kerr , whose evidence that the plank had snapped and that it had been painted was in very similar terms to the respondent 's own evidence .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
3.45,48,88,73,13,hope,"Mr Kerr said that he had never discussed the accident with the respondent , but the respondent 's brother worked in the same shipyard and it was suggested that Mr Kerr 's account of the circumstances was communicated to the respondent by members of his family .",PROCEEDINGS,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE
